# R&eacute;sum&eacute;
## About This Repo

This repository will serve to host future iterations of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. For an all inclusive look at my work experience, look for me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/asiahoe).

### Lessons

In the process of updating the r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I've learned a few simple guidelines about the tools I choose to use.

- Use the tool that is the most **usable**.
  - The tool is simple.
  - The tool is flexible.
- Use the tool that is the most **accessible**.
  - The tool is relatively inexpensive.
  - The tool outputs accessible documents.
- Use the tool that is the most **open**.
  - The tool has a helpful community and resources.
  - The tool allows me to export my document to non-destructive formats easily.

### From Word Processing to Markup

#### Microsoft Word

As I began planning revisions to my [portfolio](https://github.com/asiahoe/portfolio), I realized that I hadn't updated my r&eacute;sum&eacute; in a long time. Previously, I used word processing software like Microsoft Word, but the moment I wanted to include columns or decorative elements, the document became unnecessarily complicated and heavy. I decided to go with something better suited to design.

#### Adobe InDesign

Back in 2015, I used Adobe InDesign to create my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and get reacquainted with the software. I learn best in context, so this was a very helpful exercise that also helped me get a simple task done. However, after frequent lapses in my Creative Cloud subscription, I realized I would have to relearn the software each time as it became unfamiliar with nonuse.

While InDesign is a great tool for laying out books and other complex, multipage documents, it was a bit like using a hammer to drive in a pushpin&mdash;completely and utterly unnecessary. Simple changes in content and layout became an arduous task. It became obvious that I needed to a new tool. Or better yet, an old one; HTML and CSS.

#### HTML &amp; CSS

A r&eacute;sum&eacute; is quite simply a text document, with ideally, limited style. HTML & CSS are designed for this exact purpose. In addition, they don't require a license to write or run, and are as readable to humans as they are machines. Best of all, with CSS stylesheets, I can apply new styles at any time, both for screen and print. All of the barriers to maintaining and distributing my r&eacute;sum&eacute; were removed instantly.

### Community R&eacute;sum&eacute;s

After some research into designer and developer portfolios, I realized this would also make it very easy for me to expose my r&eacute;sum&eacute; on my website, rather than only linking to a PDF. I did a search on GitHub to find some friends had already followed the same line of thinking. Kudos, [Vincent](https://github.com/trivett/resume)! I even found a self generating [GitHub resume tool](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com). Here's [mine](https://resume.github.io/?asiahoe)!
